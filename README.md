# excalidrawai


This project is built on **[excalidraw-cli](https://github.com/swiftlysingh/excalidraw-cli)** by **Pushpinder Pal Singh** ([@swiftlysingh](https://github.com/swiftlysingh)). The original repo provides the core that makes this possible: the DSL and DOT parsers, ELK-based auto-layout, the Excalidraw generator, and the programmable API for turning graphs into Excalidraw files. All of that is theirs; without it, none of the AI or web layer would exist. Huge thanks to Pushpinder for building and open-sourcing it under the [MIT license](https://github.com/swiftlysingh/excalidraw-cli/blob/main/LICENSE).
